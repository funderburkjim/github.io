<h1>Definition 1</h1>
<div class="statement">A <i>point</i> is that which has no
part.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
The <i>Elements</i> is the prime example of an axiomatic system
from the ancient world. Its form has shaped centuries of
mathematics. An axiomatic system should begin with a list of the
terms that it will use. This definition says that one term that
will be used is that of <i>point.</i> The next few definitions give
some more terms that will be used. Although there is some
description to go along with the terms, that description is
actually never used in the exposition of the axiomatic system. It
can, at most, be used to orient the reader.
<p>The description of a point, “that which has no part,” indicates
that Euclid will be treating a point as having no width, length, or
breadth, but as an indivisible location.</p>
<p>Later definitions will define terms by means of terms defined
before them, but the first few terms in the <i>Elements</i> are not
defined by means of other terms; they’re <i>primitive</i> terms.
Their meaning comes from properties about them that are assumed
later in axioms. In the <i>Elements,</i> the axioms come in two
kinds: postulates and common notions. The first postulate, <a href="post1.html">I.Post.1</a>, for instance, gives some meaning to the
term point. It states that a straight line may be drawn between any
two points. Other postulates add more meaning to the term
point.</p>
<p>Actually, Euclid failed to notice that he made a number of
conclusions without complete justification at a number of places in
the <i>Elements.</i> This usually means that a postulate, that is,
a explicit assumption, is missing.</p>
<h4>Authenticity</h4>
This definition may or may not have been in Euclid’s original
<i>Elements</i>. Many parts of the <i>Elements</i> have been added
since the original version. Indeed, all of the formatter including
the definitions, common notions, and postulates may have been added
after Euclid.
<p>The versions that currently exist are relatively modern, and a
comparative analysis of them is required to determine which parts
of the <i>Elements</i> are not original. Some can be shown not to
be. Theon of Alexandria (ca. 335–ca. 405) edited the
<i>Elements</i> and some of the extant versions of the
<i>Elements</i> are based on his version while some are not. If a
piece of the <i>Elements</i>, such as this definition, is in both
versions, then a reasonable conclusion is that it predates Theon.
On the other hand, if a piece only occurs in Theon’s edition, then
a reasonable conclusion is that it was added by Theon or someone
later. Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine which parts of the
<i>Elements</i> may have been added between <i>Euclid</i> and
<i>Theon</i>.</p>
<p>This version of the <i>Elements</i> is based on Heiberg’s Greek
edition which is based on pre-Theonic editions, and is, therefore,
relatively authentic. Even though parts of it may have been added
in the first 650 years after Euclid, in these notes we’ll treat
Heiberg’s edition as authentic.</p>
