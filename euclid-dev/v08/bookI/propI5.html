<h1>Proposition 5</h1>
<div class="statement">In isosceles triangles the angles at the
base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are

<p>Let <i>ABC</i> be an isosceles triangle having the side
<i>AB</i> equal to the side <i>AC,</i> and let the straight lines
<i>BD</i> and <i>CE</i> be produced further in a straight line with
<i>AB</i> and <i>AC.</i></p>
<p>I say that the angle <i>ABC</i> equals the angle <i>ACB,</i> and
the angle <i>CBD</i> equals the angle <i>BCE.</i></p>

<p>Since <i>AF</i> equals AG, and <i>AB</i> equals <i>AC,</i>
therefore the two sides <i>FA</i> and <i>AC</i> equal the two sides
<i>GA</i> and <i>AB,</i> respectively, and they contain a common
angle, the angle <i>FAG.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI4.html">I.4</a></div>
<p>Therefore the base <i>FC</i> equals the base <i>GB,</i> the
triangle <i>AFC</i> equals the triangle <i>AGB,</i> and the
remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely
those opposite the equal sides, that is, the angle <i>ACF</i>
equals the angle <i>ABG,</i> and the angle <i>AFC</i> equals the
angle <i>AGB.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.3</a></div>
<p>Since the whole <i>AF</i> equals the whole <i>AG,</i> and in
these <i>AB</i> equals <i>AC,</i> therefore the remainder <i>BF</i>
equals the remainder <i>CG.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI4.html">I.4</a></div>
<p>But <i>FC</i> was also proved equal to <i>GB,</i> therefore the
two sides <i>BF</i> and <i>FC</i> equal the two sides <i>CG</i> and
<i>GB</i> respectively, and the angle <i>BFC</i> equals the angle
<i>CGB,</i> while the base <i>BC</i> is common to them. Therefore
the triangle <i>BFC</i> also equals the triangle <i>CGB,</i> and
the remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively,
namely those opposite the equal sides. Therefore the angle
<i>FBC</i> equals the angle <i>GCB,</i> and the angle <i>BCF</i>
equals the angle <i>CBG.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.3</a></div>
<p>Accordingly, since the whole angle <i>ABG</i> was proved equal
to the angle <i>ACF,</i> and in these the angle <i>CBG</i> equals
the angle <i>BCF,</i> the remaining angle <i>ABC</i> equals the
remaining angle <i>ACB,</i> and they are at the base of the
triangle <i>ABC.</i> But the angle <i>FBC</i> was also proved equal
to the angle <i>GCB,</i> and they are under the base.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal
one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further,
then the angles under the base equal one another.</i></p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
There are two conclusions for this proposition, first that the
internal base angles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ACB</i> are equal, second
that the external base angles <i>FBC</i> and <i>GCB</i> are equal.
From the diagram it looks like it would be easy to prove the second
conclusion from the first by simply subtracting the equal angles
<i>ABC</i> and <i>ACB</i> the straight angles <i>ABF</i> and
<i>ACG,</i> respectively. But Euclid doesn’t accept straight
angles, and even if he did, he hasn’t proved that all straight
angles are equal. Proposition <a href="propI13.html">I.13</a> would
be enough, since it implies the sum of angles <i>ABC</i> and
<i>FBC</i> equals two right angles, and the sum of angles
<i>ACB</i> and <i>GCB</i> also equals two right angles, and so the
two sums are equal effectively saying all straight angles are
equal.
<p>Unfortunately, such an argument would be circular. I.13 depends
on I.11, I.11 on I.8, I.8 on I.7, and I.7 on I.5. Thus, I.13 cannot
be used in the proof of I.5. It may appear that I.7 only depends on
the first conclusion of I.5, but a case of I.7 that Euclid does not
discuss relies on the second conclusion of I.5.</p>
<p>This proposition has been called the <i>Pons Asinorum</i>, or
Asses’ Bridge. Whether this name is due to its difficulty (which it
isn’t) or the resemblance of its figure to a bridge is not clear.
Very few of the propositions in the <i>Elements</i> are known by
names.</p>
<h4>Pappus’ proof</h4>
Pappus (fl. ca. 320 C.E.) gave a much shorter proof of the first
conclusion, but it is also conceptually more difficult. The two
triangles <i>BAC</i> and <i>CAB</i> have two sides equal to two
sides, namely side <i>BA</i> of the first triangle equals side
<i>CA</i> of the second triangle, and side <i>AC</i> of the first
triangle equal to side <i>AB</i> of the second, and the contained
angles are equal, namely angle <i>BAC</i> of the first triangle
equals angle <i>CAB</i> of the second, therefore, by I.4, the
corresponding parts of the two triangles are equal, in particular,
the angle <i>B</i> in the first triangle equals the angle <i>C</i>
of the second.
<p>The difficulty lies in treating one triangle as two, or in
making a correspondence between a triangle and itself, but not the
correspondence of identity. There is nothing wrong with this proof
formally, but it might be more difficult for a student just
learning geometry.</p>
<h4>Use of Proposition 5</h4>
This proposition is used in Book I for the proofs of several
propositions starting with <a href="propI7.html">I.7</a> It is also
used frequently in Books II, III, IV, VI, and XIII.
