<h1>Postulate 5</h1>
<div class="statement">That, if a straight line falling on two
straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than
two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely,
meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right
angles.</div>
</div>

Of course, this is a postulate for plane geometry. It should
include the condition that the two straight lines lie in a plane,
otherwise, skew lines in space would satisfy the hypotheses. Also,
without an ambient plane, the term “that side [of the straight
line]” has no meaning.

<td>In the diagram, if angle <i>ABE</i> plus angle <i>BED</i> is
less than two right angles (180°), then lines <i>AC</i> and
<i>DF</i> will meet when extended in the direction of <i>A</i> and
<i>D.</i>
<p>This postulate is usually called the “parallel postulate” since
it can be used to prove properties of parallel lines. Euclid
develops the theory of parallel lines in propositions <a href="propI27.html" /> through I.31.</p>

<p>The parallel postulate is historically the most interesting
postulate. Geometers throughout the ages have tried to show that it
could be proved from the remaining postulates so that it wasn’t
necessary to assume it. The process tried was to assume its
falsehood, then derive a contradiction. Many strange conclusions
follow from denying the parallel postulate, and several geometers
found such great absurdities that they concluded that the parallel
postulate did follow from the rest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these apparent absurdities are not contradictions.
In the early nineteenth century, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss
found ways of dealing with this non-Euclidean geometry by means of
analysis and accepted it as a valid kind of geometry, although very
different from Euclidean geometry. This hyperbolic geometry, as it
is called, is just as consistent as Euclidean geometry and has many
uses.</p>
<p>Thus, we know now that we must include the parallel postulate to
derive Euclidean geometry. For more on non-Euclidean geometries,
see the notes on <a href="propI29.html#hyperbolic">hyperbolic
geometry</a> after I.29 and <a href="propI16.html#elliptic">elliptic geometry</a> after I.16.</p>
<p>Euclid does not use this parallel postulate until Proposition
I.29, but nearly all of the rest of Book I depends on it. For more
commentary about the postulate see the Guides to <a href="propI29.html#guide">I.29</a> and <a href="propI29.html#guide">I.30</a>.</p>
