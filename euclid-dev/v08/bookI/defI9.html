angles that appear in the <i>Elements</i> are rectilinear as is the
illustrated angle <i>BAC.</i> Angles usually are named by three
points, the middle point the vertex of the angle. When there is no
ambiguity it is sufficient to name the angle by its vertex, in this
example, <i>A.</i></td>

<p>As treated by Euclid, rectilinear angles are magnitudes that can
be added together. When they are angles that share a side, and
their sum is less than two right angles, then their sum is the
angle between the two outer sides. For example, angles <i>BAC</i>
and <i>CAD</i> shown to the left share the side <i>AC</i>, so their
sum is angle <i>BAD</i></p>
<p>When the sum of angles happens greater than two right angles, it
is continued to be treated as a sum of angles rather than an
individual angle. For instance, in proposition <a href="propI32.html">I.32</a> it is proved that the sum of the interior
angles of a triangle equals two right angles.</p>

<h4>Measuring angles</h4>
Treating angles as magnitudes should not be confused with measuring
angles. The angles themselves are the magnitudes. The only
measurement of angles in the <i>Elements</i> is in terms of right
angles (defined in the next definition). Degree measurement and
radian measurement were not used until later. In terms of degrees a
right angle is 90°, while in terms of radians a right angle is
<i>π</i>/2 radians.
<p>Throughout ancient Greek mathematics, only positive magnitudes
were considered. Zero and negative magnitudes were not conceived.
For the most part, a lack of zero and negative magnitudes
complicates mathematics, but occasionally simplifies it. In any
case, the power of a mathematics without zero and negative
magnitudes is no less in the sense that any statement made using
the language of zero or negative magnitudes can be translated into
a statement that doesn’t use them, although the translated
statement may be longer and less understandable.</p>
<p>Although in modern mathematics, angles can be positive,
negative, or zero, and can be greater than a full circle (360° or
2<i>π</i> radians), in the <i>Elements</i> angles are always
greater than zero and less than two right angles (180° or <i>π</i>
radians), except perhaps in one interpretation of proposition
<a href="../bookIII/propIII20.html">III.20</a> where the central
angle of a circle could be greater than two right angles.</p>
