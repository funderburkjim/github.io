<h1>Definition 10</h1>
<div class="statement">When a straight line standing on a straight
line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the
equal angles is <i>right,</i> and the straight line standing on the
other is called a <i>perpendicular</i> to that on which it
stands.</div>

<p>In the figure, the two angles <i>DBA</i> and <i>DBC</i> are
equal, so they are right angles by definition, and so the line
<i>BD</i> set up on the line <i>AC</i> is perpendicular to it.
Later there will be a postulate (<a href="post4.html">Post.4</a>)
which states that all right angles are equal, and after a few
propositions, it can be shown that <i>AC</i> is also perpendicular
to <i>BD.</i> There are no postulates that explicitly state
perpendiculars exist. Instead a construction for them is given and
proved in proposition <a href="propI11.html">I.11</a>.</p>
<p>The word orthogonal is frequently used in mathematics as a
synonym for perpendicular.</p>

<p>This is the first mention in the <i>Elements</i> of magnitudes
being equal. There are several different kinds of magnitudes in the
<i>Elements</i> besides angles. Lines, plane figures, and solids
are also kinds of magnitudes. Some of the assumptions about
magnitudes are stated later as common notions <a href="cn.html">C.N.</a>, which are often called axioms. One thing that
magnitudes of the same kind can be is “equal,” as the angles in
this definition can be. Nowhere does Euclid explicitly state what
it means for angles to be equal—or for that matter, for lines,
plane figures, or solids to be equal—although much can be
determined by the way he uses equality.</p>
