<h1>Definition 6</h1>
<div class="statement">The edges of a surface are lines.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
<p>As in <a href="defI3.html">I.Def.3</a>, this statement describes
a certain relationship, but this time between surfaces and lines.
For example, a hemisphere is a surface, and its edge is the
circumference of a circle, a kind of line.</p>
<p>This definition cannot actually be used since there are no
postulates to go along with it to connect the edges of a surface in
any way to the surface.</p>
<p>Euclid uses the same term for the end of a line in <a href="defI3.html">I.Def.3</a>, the edge of a surface in this definition,
and the surface of a solid in <a href="../bookXI/defXI1.html">XI.Def.2</a>. That term could be translated
as “that which is around,” “the limits of,” or “the extremities
of,” but in English the terms “the ends of” a line, “the edges of”
a surface, and either “the surfaces of” or “the faces of” a solid
are fairly standard for different dimensions.</p>
