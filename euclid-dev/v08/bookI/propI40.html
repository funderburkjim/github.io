<h1>Proposition 40</h1>
<div class="statement">Equal triangles which are on equal bases and

<p>Let <i>ABC</i> and <i>CDE</i> be equal triangles on equal bases

</div>
<p>I say that they are also in the same parallels.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="post1.html">I.Post.1</a></div>
<p>Join <i>AD.</i> I say that <i>AD</i> is parallel to
<i>BE.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI31.html">I.31</a>, <a href="post1.html">I.Post.1</a></div>
<p>If not, draw <i>AF</i> through <i>A</i> parallel to <i>BE,</i>
and join <i>FE.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI38.html">I.38</a></div>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle
<i>FCE,</i> for they are on equal bases <i>BC</i> and <i>CE</i> and
in the same parallels <i>BE</i> and <i>AF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.1</a></div>
<p>But the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle <i>DCE,</i>
therefore the triangle <i>DCE</i> also equals the triangle
<i>FCE,</i> the greater equals the less, which is impossible.
Therefore <i>AF</i> is not parallel to <i>BE.</i></p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line
except <i>AD,</i> therefore <i>AD</i> is parallel to <i>BE.</i></p>
<p>Therefore <i>equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the
same side are also in the same parallels.</i></p>

The statement and the setting out of this proposition are not up to
Euclid’s standards. This is supposed to be a converse to <a href="propI38.html">I.38</a>. The statement should state the the bases
are along the same line, but it doesn’t. There is no justification
for assuming that the point <i>C</i> is a common vertex of the two
triangles. Fortunately, the proof works just as well if <i>C</i> is
split into two points.
<p>For some of the propositions and many of the lemmas and
corollaries in the <i>Elements,</i> there is evidence that Euclid
did not write them, but they were added later. The process of
incorporating new material in textbooks was almost automatic when
the books were copied by hand instead of printed. Scholars wrote
comments (called “scholia”, singular “scholium”) in the margins of
the texts, and copyists (some of whom were later scholars) would
include those comments as part of the text in their new copies.</p>
<p>Heiberg could show by means of an early papyrus fragment that
this proposition was an early interpolation. For others, such as
<a href="propI37.html">I.37</a> there is no direct evidence, only a
doubt that a mathematician of Euclid’s caliber would have included
them.</p>
<p>Unlike the other propositions in Book I, this one is not used
later in the <i>Elements.</i></p>
