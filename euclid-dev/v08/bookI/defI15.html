A definition such as this describes what circles are. Definitions
do not guarantee the existence of the things they define. The
existence of circles follows from a postulate, namely, <a href="post3.html">Post.3</a>.
<p>Note that a circle for Euclid is a two-dimensional figure. But
in modern mathematics, usually the word circle refers to what
Euclid calls the circumference of a circle.</p>

<p>The center of the circle in the diagram is the point <i>C.</i>
It’s interesting that the English word “center” derives from the
Greek word which also means a prod or a poker, and it refers to the
fixed leg of a compass used to draw a circle.</p>
<p>There is no assumption in the definition that there is only one
center of a circle. Proposition <a href="../bookIII/propIII1.html">III.1</a> gives a construction for the
center of a circle, and the proof of that proposition shows that
the center is unique.</p>
<p>The (curved) line <i>ABD</i> that contains the circle is its
circumference. Euclid typically names a circle by three points on
its circumference. Perhaps a better translation than
“circumference” would be “periphery” since that is the Greek word
while “circumference” derives from the Latin.</p>
<p>Euclid doesn’t have a term for radius other than “that from the
center,” but radius is such a useful word that it is used here to
translate “that from the center,” such as the radius <i>CD.</i></p>

<p>An example diameter is the line <i>AB</i> which passes through
the center. Of course, a diameter is twice a radius, and since the
radii are all equal to each other by definition, the diameters are
also all equal to each other.</p>
<p>That diameters “also bisects the circle” should not be part of
the definition, but either assumed as a postulate or proved as a
proposition. It depends on the fact that circles are drawn on
planes, and planes have constant curvature. The analogous figure on
a surface of nonconstant curvature does not have this property. For
such figures the two “semicircles” on either side of a “diameter”
need not be equal.</p>
<p>Although circles are used throughout Book I to measure and
transfer distances, the proper theory of circles doesn’t begin
until <a href="../bookIII/bookIII.html">Book III</a>. That book
begins with more definitions relating to circles including the
equality of circles, when circles touch (are tangent to) lines and
other circles, and so forth.</p>
