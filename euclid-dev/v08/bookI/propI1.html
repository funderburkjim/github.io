<p>It is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the
straight line <i>AB.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="post3.html">I.Post.3</a><br />
<a href="post1.html">I.Post.1</a></div>
<p>Describe the circle <i>BCD</i> with center <i>A</i> and radius
<i>AB.</i> Again describe the circle <i>ACE</i> with center
<i>B</i> and radius <i>BA.</i> Join the straight lines <i>CA</i>
and <i>CB</i> from the point <i>C</i> at which the circles cut one
another to the points <i>A</i> and <i>B.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="defI15.html">I.Def.15</a></div>
<p>Now, since the point <i>A</i> is the center of the circle
<i>CDB,</i> therefore <i>AC</i> equals <i>AB.</i> Again, since the
point <i>B</i> is the center of the circle <i>CAE,</i> therefore
<i>BC</i> equals <i>BA.</i></p>
<p>But <i>AC</i> was proved equal to <i>AB,</i> therefore each of
the straight lines <i>AC</i> and <i>BC</i> equals <i>AB.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.1</a></div>
<p>And things which equal the same thing also equal one another,
therefore <i>AC</i> also equals <i>BC.</i></p>
<p>Therefore the three straight lines <i>AC, AB,</i> and <i>BC</i>
equal one another.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defI20.html">I.Def.20</a></div>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> is equilateral, and it has
been constructed on the given finite straight line <i>AB.</i></p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
This proposition is a very pleasant choice for the first
proposition in the <i>Elements.</i> The construction of the
triangle is clear, and the proof that it is an equilateral triangle
is evident. Of course, there are two choices for the point
<i>C,</i> but either one will do.
<p>Euclid could have chosen proposition <a href="propI4.html">I.4</a> to come first, since it doesn’t logically
depend on the previous three, but there are some good reasons for
putting I.1 first. For one thing, the <i>Elements</i> ends with
constructions of the five regular solids in Book XIII, so it is a
nice aesthetic touch to begin with the construction of a regular
triangle. More important, though, is I.1 is needed in <a href="propI2.html">I.2</a>, and that in <a href="propI3.html">I.3</a>.
Propositions I.2 and I.3 give constructions for moving lines, and
I.4, although not logically dependent on I.2 or I.3, does use the
concept of superposition which involves, in some sense, moving
points and lines.</p>
<h4>Marginal references to postulates, definitions, etc.</h4>
The abbreviations in the right column refer to postulates,
definitions, common notions, and previously proved propositions.
Each indicates a justification of a construction or conclusion in a
sentence to its left. They are not part of Euclid’s
<i>Elements,</i> but it is a tradition to include them as a guide
to the reader.
<p>Sometimes the justification is quoted in full as C.N.1 is here,
but usually it is left to the reader to determine the
justification.</p>
<h4>Q.E.F. and Q.E.D. at the ends of proofs</h4>
The Q.E.F. at the end of the proof is an abbreviation for the Latin
words <i>quod erat faciendum</i> which means “which was to be
done.” A few of the propositions, as this one and the next two,
solve problems by constructions. These are the ones that end with
Q.E.F. (they’re also printed in red here in the listings of
propositions for each book.)
<p>The rest of the proofs end with Q.E.D. instead, an abbreviation
for <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i> which means “which was to be
demonstrated.” It’s convenient to have a standard way to indicate
the end of a proof. These Latin abbreviations are a bit of an
anachronism. It would be less of an anachronism to use
abbreviations for the original Greek phrase, or abbreviations for a
modern English phrase since the rest of this version of the
<i>Elements</i> is in English. But by now, Q.E.F. and Q.E.D. are
traditional. In recent decades a small square has become common as
a symbol to indicate the end of a proof.</p>
<h4>Critiques of the proof</h4>
It is surprising that such a short, clear, and understandable proof
can be so full of holes. These are logical gaps where statements
are made with insufficient justification. Since the first proof in
the <i>Elements</i> is the one in this proposition, it has received
more criticism over the centuries than any other.
<p><b>Why does the point <i>C</i> exist?</b> Near the beginning of
the proof, the point <i>C</i> is mentioned where the circles are
supposed to intersect, but there is no justification for its
existence. The only one of Euclid’s postulate that says a point
exists the parallel postulate, and that postulate is not relevant
here. Indeed, some postulate is needed for that conclusion, such as
“If the sum of the radii of two circles is greater than the line
joining their centers, then the two circles intersect.” Such a
postulate is also needed in Proposition <a href="propI22.html">I.22</a>. There are models of geometry in which the
circles do not intersect. Thus, other postulates not mentioned by
Euclid are required. In Book III, Euclid takes some care in
analyzing the possible ways that circles can meet, but even with
more care, there are missing postulates.</p>
<p><b>Why is <i>ABC</i> a plane figure?</b> After concluding the
three straight lines <i>AC, AB,</i> and <i>BC</i> are equal, what
is the justification that they contain a plane figure <i>ABC</i>?
Recall that a triangle is a plane figure bounded by contained by
three lines. These lines have not been shown to lie in a plane and
that the entire figure lies in a plane. It is proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI1.html">XI.1</a> that claims that all parts of a
line lie in a plane, and <a href="../bookXI/propXI2.html">XI.2</a>
that claims that the entire triangle lie in a plane. Logically,
they should precede I.1. The reason they don’t, of course, is that
those propositions belong to solid geometry, and plane geometry is
developed first in the <i>Elements,</i> also, no doubt, plane
geometry developed first historically.</p>
<p><b>Why does <i>ABC</i> contain an equilateral triangle?</b>
Proclus relates that early on there were critiques of the proof and
describes that of Zeno of Sidon, an Epicurean philosopher of the
early first century B.C.E. (not to be confused with Zeno of Elea
famous of the paradoxes who lived long before Euclid), and whose
criticisms, Proclus says, were refuted in a book by Posidonius. The
critique is sound, however, and the refutation faulty.</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td>Zeno of Sidon criticized the proof because it was not shown
that the sides do not meet before they reach the vertices. Suppose
<i>AC</i> and <i>BC</i> meet at <i>E</i> before they reach
<i>C,</i> that is, the straight lines <i>AEC</i> and <i>BEC</i>
have a common segment <i>EC.</i> Then they would contain a triangle
<i>ABE</i> which is not equilateral, but isosceles.
<p>Zeno recognized that in order to destroy his counterexample it
was necessary to assume that straight lines cannot have a common
segment. Proclus relates a supposed proof of that statement, the
same one found in proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI1.html">XI.1</a>, but it is faulty. Proclus and
Posidonius quoted properties of lines and circles that were never
proven and never explicitly assumed as postulates.</p>

<p>The possibilities that haven’t been excluded are much more
numerous than Zeno’s example. The sides could meet numerous times
and the region they contain could look like a necklace of bubbles.
What needs to be shown (or assumed as a postulate) is that two
infinitely extended straight lines can meet in at most one
point.</p>
