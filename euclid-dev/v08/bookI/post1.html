<td>This first postulate says that given any two points such as
<i>A</i> and <i>B,</i> there is a line <i>AB</i> which has them as
endpoints. This is one of the constructions that may be done with a
straightedge (the other being described in the next
postulate).</td>

<p>Although it doesn’t explicitly say so, there is a unique line
between the two points. Since Euclid uses this postulate as if it
includes the uniqueness as part of it, he really ought to have
stated the uniqueness explicitly.</p>
<p>The last three books of the <i>Elements</i> cover solid
geometry, and for those, the two points mentioned in the postulate
may be any two points in space. Proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI1.html">XI.1</a> claims that if part of a line is
contained in a plane, then the whole line is. In the books on plane
geometry, it is implicitly assumed that the line <i>AB</i> joining
<i>A</i> to <i>B</i> lies in the plane of discussion.</p>
