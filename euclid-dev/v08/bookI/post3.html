<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
This is the third assumed construction in the <i>Elements.</i> It
corresponds to drawing a circle with a compass.
<table cellspacing="5">
<tr>

<p>Circles were defined in <a href="defI15.html">Def.I.15</a> and
Def.I.16 as plane figures with the property that there is a certain
point, called the <i>center</i> of the circle, such that all
straight lines from the center to the boundary are equal. That is,
all the radii are equal.</p>
<p>The given data are (1) a point <i>A</i> to be the center of the
circle, (2) another point <i>B</i> to be on the circumference of
the circle, and (3) a plane in which the two points lie. In the
first few books of the <i>Elements,</i> there is but one plane
under consideration and needn’t be mentioned, but in the last three
books which develop solid geometry, the plane has to be
specified.</p>

<p>Note that this postulate does not allow for the compass to be
moved. The usual way that a compass is used is that is is opened to
a given width, then the pivot is placed on the drawing surface,
then a circle is drawn as the compass is rotated around the pivot.
But this postulate does not allow for transferring distances. It is
as if the compass collapses as soon as it’s removed from the plane.
Proposition <a href="propI3.html">I.3</a>, however, gives a
construction for transferring distances. Therefore, the same
constructions that can be made with a regular compass can also be
made with Euclid’s collapsing compass.</p>
