<h1>Proposition 19</h1>
<div class="statement">In any triangle the side opposite the
greater angle is greater.</div>
<p>Let <i>ABC</i> be a triangle having the angle <i>ABC</i> greater
than the angle <i>BCA.</i></p>
<div class="ldiagram">
<div id="ap1"><object height="220" width="170"><param name="background" value="35,19,100" />
 <param name="title" value="I.19" />
 <param name="e[1]" value="A;point;free;130,40" />
 <param name="e[2]" value="B;point;free;40,80" />
 <param name="e[3]" value="C;point;free;70,180" />
 <param name="e[4]" value="ABC;polygon;triangle;A,B,C;0;0;black;random" /></object></div>
</div>
<p>I say that the side <i>AC</i> is greater than the side
<i>AB.</i></p>
<p>If not, either <i>AC</i> equals <i>AB</i> or it is less than
it.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI5.html">I.5</a></div>
<p>Now <i>AC</i> does not equal <i>AB,</i> for then the angle
<i>ABC</i> would equal the angle <i>ACB,</i> but it does not.
Therefore <i>AC</i> does not equal <i>AB.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI18.html">I.18</a></div>
<p>Neither is <i>AC</i> less than <i>AB,</i> for then the angle
<i>ABC</i> would be less than the angle <i>ACB,</i> but it is not.
Therefore <i>AC</i> is not less than <i>AB.</i></p>
<p>And it was proved that it is not equal either. Therefore
<i>AC</i> is greater than <i>AB.</i></p>
<p>Therefore <i>in any triangle the side opposite the greater angle
is greater.</i></p>

As mentioned before, this proposition is a disguised converse of
the previous one. As Euclid often does, he uses a proof by
contradiction involving the already proved converse to prove this
proposition. It is not that there is a logical connection between
this statement and its converse that makes this tactic work, but
some kind of symmetry involved. In this case, if one side is less
than another, then the other is greater than the one, and the
previous proposition applies. So the relevant symmetry is between
“lesser” and “greater.”
<h4>The law of sines</h4>
Although some of the geometric underpinnings of trigonometry appear
in the <i>Elements,</i> trigonometry itself does not. Trigonometry
makes its appearance among later Greek mathematics where the the
basic trigonometric function is the <i>chord,</i> which is related
to the <i>sine.</i>

<td>Without going into details, the law of sines contains more
precise information about the relation between angles and sides of
a triangle than this and the last proposition did. The law of sines
states that
<center><img alt="sin A divided by BC equals sin B divided by AC equals sin C divided by AB" height="48" src="propI19b.gif" width="209" /></center>
<p>where <i>a</i> denotes the side opposite angle <i>A</i>,
<i>b</i> denotes the side opposite angle <i>B</i>, and <i>c</i>
denotes the side opposite angle <i>C</i>. In other words, the sine
of an angle in a triangle is proportional to the opposite side.</p>
<p>By means of the law of sines the size of a angle can be related
directly to the length of the opposite side.</p>

<h4>Use of Proposition 19</h4>
This proposition is used in the proofs of propositions <a href="propI20.html">I.20</a>, <a href="propI24.html">I.24</a>, and some
others in Book III.
