<p>It is required to draw a straight line perpendicular to the
given infinite straight line <i>AB</i> from the given point
<i>C</i> which is not on it.</p>

<a href="propI10.html">I.10</a>, <a href="post1.html">I.Post.1</a></div>
<p>Take an arbitrary point <i>D</i> on the other side of the
straight line <i>AB,</i> and describe the circle <i>EFG</i> with
center <i>C</i> and radius <i>CD.</i> Bisect the straight line
<i>EG</i> at <i>H,</i> and join the straight lines <i>CG, CH,</i>
and <i>CE.</i></p>
<p>I say that <i>CH</i> has been drawn perpendicular to the given
infinite straight line <i>AB</i> from the given point <i>C</i>
which is not on it.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defI15.html">I.Def.15</a><br />
<a href="propI8.html">I.8</a></div>
<p>Since <i>GH</i> equals <i>HE,</i> and <i>HC</i> is common,
therefore the two sides <i>GH</i> and <i>HC</i> equal the two sides
<i>EH</i> and <i>HC</i> respectively, and the base <i>CG</i> equals
the base <i>CE.</i> Therefore the angle <i>CHG</i> equals the angle
<i>EHC,</i> and they are adjacent angles.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="defI10.html">I.Def.10</a></div>
<p>But, when a straight line standing on a straight line makes the
adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is
right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a
perpendicular to that on which it stands.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>CH</i> has been drawn perpendicular to the given
infinite straight line <i>AB</i> from the given point <i>C</i>
which is not on it.</p>

Again, the double-equilateral-triangle construction is used, but
this time the preparation of the starting line <i>EG</i> is
different. The point <i>D</i> is taken on the other side of the
line <i>AB</i> to insure that circle meets the line <i>AB</i> in at
least two points, <i>E</i> and <i>G.</i> If <i>D</i> is taken on
the line <i>AB,</i> it might be taken at <i>H,</i> and the
resulting circle would touch the line only at <i>H</i>; and if
<i>D</i> is taken on the same side of <i>AB,</i> then the circle
could miss the line entirely.
<p>Euclid does not precede this proposition with propositions
investigating how lines meet circles. He is much more careful in
Book III on circles in which the first dozen or so propositions lay
foundations. For instance, Proposition <a href="../bookIII/propIII10.html">III.10</a> states that a circle does
not cut a circle at more than two points. Even so, some
propositions are missing. One is needed for this proposition to
justify the existence of the two points <i>C</i> and <i>E</i> where
the line <i>AB</i> meets circle with center <i>C</i> and radius
<i>CD.</i> Such a proposition would state “A circle whose center is
on one side of a line and on whose circumference lies a point on
the other side of the line meets the line at two points.”</p>
<p>Incidentally, Proclus explains in his commentary on Book I that
the problem of constructing the perpendicular was investigated by
Oenopides of Chios who lived sometime in the middle of the fifth
century B.C.E., a century and a half before Euclid.</p>
<h4>Use of Proposition 12</h4>
The construction of this proposition is not used in Book I, but it
is used on occasion in the remaining geometric books, namely, Books
II through IV, VI, and XI through XIII.
