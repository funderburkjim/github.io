<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is also parallel to <i>CD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI29.html">I.29</a></div>
<p>Let the straight line <i>GK</i> fall upon them. Since the
straight line <i>GK</i> falls on the parallel straight lines
<i>AB</i> and <i>EF,</i> therefore the angle <i>AGK</i> equals the
angle <i>GHF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI29.html">I.29</a></div>
<p>Again, since the straight line <i>GK</i> falls on the parallel
straight lines <i>EF</i> and <i>CD,</i> therefore the angle
<i>GHF</i> equals the angle <i>GKD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.1</a></div>
<p>But the angle <i>AGK</i> was also proved equal to the angle
<i>GHF.</i> Therefore the angle <i>AGK</i> also equals the angle
<i>GKD,</i> and they are alternate.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>AB</i> is parallel to <i>CD.</i></p>
<p>Therefore <i>straight lines parallel to the same straight line
are also parallel to one another.</i></p>

For this proposition it is supposed that the three lines lie in one
plane. Proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI9.html">XI.9</a>
applies to the case where the three lines do not lie in a plane.
<h4>Playfair’s axiom</h4>
A number of the propositions in the <i>Elements</i> are equivalent
to the parallel postulate <a href="post5.html">Post.5</a> in the
sense that if the rest of the postulates are assumed and any one of
these propositions is assumed, then the parallel postulate can be
proved as a proposition. This one I.30, the last <a href="propI29.html">I.29</a>, either part of <a href="propI32.html">I.32</a>, and almost any later one. Thus, Euclid had
many statements to choose from to take as a postulate.
<p>In many modern expositions of synthetic geometry, Playfair’s
axiom (John Playfair, 1748–1819) is chosen as that postulate
instead of Euclid’s parallel postulate Post.5. Playfair’s axiom
states that there is at most one line parallel to a given line
passing through a given point. (That there is at least one follows
from the next proposition <a href="propI31.html">I.31</a>, which
doesn’t depend on the parallel postulate.)</p>
<p>Two advantages of Playfair’s axiom over Euclid’s parallel
postulate are that it is a simpler statement, and it emphasizes the
distinction between Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<p>Two disadvantages are that it does not have the historical
importance of Euclid’s parallel postulate, and the proof of the
parallel postulate from Playfair’s axiom is nonconstructive. That
proof is a proof by contradiction that begins assuming that a point
does not exist, deriving a contradiction, and concluding that the
point must exist, but does not construct it. It may well be that
Euclid chose to make the construction an assumption of his parallel
postulate rather rather than choosing some other equivalent
statement for his postulate.</p>
<h4>Elegance in mathematics</h4>
Euclid’s <i>Elements</i> form one of the most beautiful works of
science in the history of humankind. This beauty lies more in the
logical development of geometry rather than in geometry itself. It
is not the diagrams that excite our interest; rather it is the
concepts, the way the concepts interconnect, and the way Euclid
selected and presented these concepts and their interconnections.
The <i>Elements</i> are elegant. Elegance in mathematics is
characterized by simplicity and clarity. An elegant presentation is
easy for the reader to follow. But elegance is not only in the
presentation, it is in the selection of definitions and proofs. The
elegant definition is the one that makes the rest of the theory
easy. The elegant proof is the one that is easiest to follow, one
that is designed just right to fit the goal. Extraneous concepts
should not be involved. Even the goals need to be adjusted to the
right level of generality to cover the concepts, but not so
abstract that the abstraction itself obscures the goal.
<p>One of the criticisms of Euclid’s parallel postulate was that it
isn’t simple.The statement of this proposition, I.30, is much
simpler, and Playfair’s axiom is much simpler. As they’re each
logically equivalent to Euclid’s parallel postulate, if elegance
were the primary goal, then Euclid would have chosen one of them in
place of his postulate. Perhaps the reasons mentioned above explain
why Euclid used Post.5 instead.</p>
