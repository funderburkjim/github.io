<p>If the triangle <i>ABC</i> is superposed on the triangle
<i>DEF,</i> and if the point <i>A</i> is placed on the point
<i>D</i> and the straight line <i>AB</i> on <i>DE,</i> then the
point <i>B</i> also coincides with <i>E,</i> because <i>AB</i>
equals <i>DE.</i></p>
<p>Again, <i>AB</i> coinciding with <i>DE,</i> the straight line
<i>AC</i> also coincides with <i>DF,</i> because the angle
<i>BAC</i> equals the angle <i>EDF.</i> Hence the point <i>C</i>
also coincides with the point <i>F,</i> because <i>AC</i> again
equals <i>DF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.4</a></div>
<p>But <i>B</i> also coincides with <i>E,</i> hence the base
<i>BC</i> coincides with the base <i>EF</i> and equals it.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.4</a></div>
<p>Thus the whole triangle <i>ABC</i> coincides with the whole
triangle <i>DEF</i> and equals it.</p>
<p>And the remaining angles also coincide with the remaining angles
and equal them, the angle <i>ABC</i> equals the angle <i>DEF,</i>
and the angle <i>ACB</i> equals the angle <i>DFE.</i></p>
<p>Therefore <i>if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides
respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight
lines equal, then they also have the base equal to the base, the
triangle equals the triangle, and the remaining angles equal the
remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal
sides.</i></p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
This is the first of the congruence propositions for triangles.
Euclid did not explicitly use the concept of congruence, although
it would have simplified his exposition a bit. The definition of
congruence would include the hypotheses and conclusions of this
proposition, that is, two triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>DEF</i> are
<i>congruent</i> if angles <i>A, B,</i> and <i>C</i> are equal to
angles <i>D, E,</i> and <i>F</i> respectively, and sides <i>AB,
BC,</i> and <i>AC</i> are equal to sides <i>DE, EF,</i> and
<i>DF</i> respectively, and the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the
triangle <i>DEF</i>(by which is meant that they have the same
area). In the books on solid geometry, Euclid uses the phrase
“similar and equal” for congruence, but similarity is not defined
until Book VI, so that phrase would be out of place in the first
part of the <i>Elements.</i>
<p><a id="guide" name="guide">For more discussion of congruence
theorems see the</a> <a href="propI26.html#cong">note</a> after
proposition I.26, the last of the congruence propositions.</p>
<p>Euclid frequently refers to one side of a triangle as its
“base,” leaving the other two named “sides.” Any one of the sides
might be chosen as the base, but once chosen, it remains the base
for the rest of the discussion. This is simply a linguistic device
to save words.</p>
<h4>The method of superposition</h4>
The method of proof used in this proposition is sometimes called
“superposition.” It apparently is not a method that Euclid prefers
since he so rarely uses it, only here in I.4 and in <a href="propI8.html">I.8</a> and <a href="../bookIII/propIII24.html">III.24</a>, but not in many other
propositions in which he could have used it.
<p>It is not clear what is meant by “superposing a triangle on a
triangle” means. It has been variously interpreted as actually
moving one triangle to cover the other or as simply associating
parts of one triangle with parts of the other. For the two
triangles illustrated in the figure, you can actually slide one
over the other in a continuous motion within the plane. Note,
however, that if one triangle is the mirror image of the other,
then any continuous motion would require moving one triangle
outside of the plane. But the triangles don’t have to be same plane
to begin with, and they often are not in the same plane when this
proposition is invoked in the books on solid geometry.</p>
<p>Whatever the intended meaning of superposition may be, there are
no postulates to allow any conclusions based on superposition. One
possibility is to add postulates based on a group of
transformations of space, or if restricted to plane geometry, on a
group of transformations of the plane. Charles Dodgson (a.k.a.
Lewis Carroll) would have said that using group theory is not
appropriate to an elementary exposition of Euclidean geometry.
Heath has described a more elementary conservative basis in his
commentary on this proposition.</p>
<p>Yet another alternative is to simply take this proposition as a
postulate, or part of it as a postulate. For instance, Hilbert in
his <i>Foundations of Geometry</i> takes as given that under the
hypotheses of this proposition that the remaining angles equal the
remaining angles. Then, Hilbert proves that the base equals the
base.</p>
<h4>Use of Proposition 4</h4>
Of the various congruence theorems, this one is the most used. This
proposition is used frequently in Book I starting with the next two
propositions, and it is often used in the rest of the books on
geometry, namely, Books II, III, IV, VI, XI, XII, and XIII.
<p>Although the two triangles in this proposition appear to be in
the same plane, that is not necessary. In Proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI4.html">XI.4</a> and many others in Book XI this
proposition is applied to pairs of triangles in different
planes.</p>
