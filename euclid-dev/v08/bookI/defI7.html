<h1>Definition 7</h1>
<div class="statement">A <i>plane surface</i> is a surface which
lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
We see now that a plane surface, usually abbreviated to the single
word “plane,” is a kind of surface. Perhaps the remainder of the
statement is a definition of content, but, if so, some words are
missing.
<p>One interpretation often given is that if a plane surface
contains two points, then it contains the line connecting the two
points. If that were the meaning, then it would be just as well to
make that the explicit definition or to make it a postulate. But
that does not seem to be Euclid’s intent. His proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI7.html">XI.7</a> has a detailed proof that the
line joining two points on two parallel lines lies in the plane of
the two parallel lines. No proof at all would be necessary if that
line were by definition or by postulate contained in a plane that
contained its ends.</p>
<p>Note that a plane surface may be infinite, but needn’t be
infinite. It can be a square, a circle, or any other plane figure
(<a href="defI19.html">Def.I.19</a>).</p>
<p>There are no postulates in the <i>Elements</i> for the existence
of plane surfaces, either finite or infinite. <a href="post3.html">Post.3</a> says circles can be drawn, but a ambient
plane is implicitly required there. Rectilinear figures are assumed
to exist once the bounding lines have been constructed, but again,
a plane is presumed to exist first. Throughout Books I through IV
and Book VI, the books on plane geometry, there is the implicit
assumption of one plane in which all the points, lines, and circles
lie. In the books on solid geometry, Books XI through XIII, there
is sometimes mentioned a plane of reference, and proposition
<a href="../bookXI/propXI2.html">XI.2</a> claims that two
intersecting lines determine a plane as does any triangle (but its
proof fails completely).</p>
