<h1>Proposition 16</h1>
<div class="statement">In any triangle, if one of the sides is
produced, then the exterior angle is greater than either of the

<p>Let <i>ABC</i> be a triangle, and let one side of it <i>BC</i>
be produced to <i>D.</i></p>
<p>I say that the exterior angle <i>ACD</i> is greater than either
of the interior and opposite angles <i>CBA</i> and <i>BAC.</i></p>

<p>Since <i>AE</i> equals <i>EC,</i> and <i>BE</i> equals
<i>EF,</i> therefore the two sides <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> equal
the two sides <i>CE</i> and <i>EF</i> respectively, and the angle
<i>AEB</i> equals the angle <i>FEC,</i> for they are vertical
angles. Therefore the base <i>AB</i> equals the base <i>FC,</i> the
triangle <i>ABE</i> equals the triangle <i>CFE,</i> and the
remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely
those opposite the equal sides. Therefore the angle <i>BAE</i>
equals the angle <i>ECF.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.5</a></div>
<p>But the angle <i>ECD</i> is greater than the angle <i>ECF,</i>
therefore the angle <i>ACD</i> is greater than the angle
<i>BAE.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI15.html">I.15</a></div>
<p>Similarly, if <i>BC</i> is bisected, then the angle <i>BCG,</i>
that is, the angle <i>ACD,</i> can also be proved to be greater
than the angle <i>ABC.</i></p>
<p>Therefore <i>in any triangle, if one of the sides is produced,
then the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and
opposite angles.</i></p>

In the later proposition <a href="propI32.html">I.32</a>, after he
invokes the parallel postulate <a href="post5.html">I.Post.5</a>,
Euclid shows the stronger result that the exterior angle of a
triangle equals the sum of the interior, opposite angles.
<h4><a id="elliptic" name="elliptic">Elliptic geometry</a></h4>
There are geometries besides Euclidean geometry. Two of the more
important geometries are elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry,
which were developed in the nineteenth century. The first 15
propositions in Book I hold in elliptic geometry, but not this one.
(For more on hyperbolic geometry, see the <a href="propI29.html#hyperbolic">note</a> after Proposition I.29.)
<p>Plane elliptic geometry is closely related to spherical
geometry, but it differs in that antipodal points on the sphere are
identified. Thus, a “point” in an elliptic plane is a pair of
antipodal points on the sphere. A “straight line” in an elliptic
plane is an arc of great circle on the sphere. When a “straight
line” is extended, its ends eventually meet so that, topologically,
it becomes a circle. This is very different from Euclidean geometry
since here the ends of a line never meet when extended.</p>

<p>The illustration on the right shows the stereographic projection
of one hemisphere. Since only one hemisphere is displayed, each
“point” is represented by one point except those “points” such as
<i>D, E,</i> and <i>F</i> on the blue bounding great circle which
appear twice.</p>
<p>A “triangle” in elliptic geometry, such as <i>ABC,</i> is a
spherical triangle (or, more precisely, a pair of antipodal
spherical triangles). The internal angle sum of a spherical
triangle is always greater than 180°, but less than 540°, whereas
in Euclidean geometry, the internal angle sum of a triangle is 180°
as shown in Proposition <a href="propI32.html">I.32</a>.</p>
<p>Elliptic geometry satisfies some of the postulates of Euclidean
geometry, but not all of them under all interpretations. Usually,
<a href="post1.html">I.Post.1</a>, to draw a straight line from any
point to any point, is interpreted to include the uniqueness of
that line. But in elliptic geometry a completed “straight line” is
topologically a circle so that any pair of points on it divide it
into two arcs. Therefore, in elliptic geometry exactly two
“straight lines” join any two given “points.”</p>

<p>Also, <a href="post2.html">I.Post.2</a>, to produce a finite
straight line continuously in a straight line, is sometimes
interpreted to include the condition that its ends don’t meet when
extended. Under that interpretation, elliptic geometry fails
Postulate 2.</p>
<p>Elliptic geometry fails <a href="post5.html">I.Post.5</a>, the
parallel postulate, as well, since any two “straight lines” in an
elliptic plane meet. That is, any two great circles on the sphere
meet at a pair of antipodal points.</p>
<p>Finally, a completed “straight line” in the elliptic plane does
not divide the plane into two parts as infinite straight lines do
in the Euclidean plane. A completed “straight line” in the elliptic
plane is a great circle on the sphere. Any two “points” not on that
“straight line” include two points in the same hemisphere, and they
can be joined by an arc that doesn’t meet the great circle.
Therefore two “points” lie on the same side of the completed
“straight line.”</p>
<p>The proof of this particular proposition fails for elliptic
geometry, and the statement of the proposition is false for
elliptic geometry. In particular, the statement “the angle
<i>ECD</i> is greater than the angle <i>ECF</i>” is not true of all
triangles in elliptic geometry. The line <i>CF</i> need not be
contained in the angle <i>ACD.</i> All the previous propositions do
hold in elliptic geometry and some of the later propositions, too,
but some need different proofs.</p>
<h4>Use of Proposition 16</h4>
This proposition is used in the proofs of the next two
propositions, a few others in this book, and a couple in Book III.
