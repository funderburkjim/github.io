<h1>Proposition 29</h1>
<div class="statement">A straight line falling on parallel straight
lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the exterior
angle equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the sum of the
interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles.</div>
<p>Let the straight line <i>EF</i> fall on the parallel straight
lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD.</i></p>
<p>I say that it makes the alternate angles <i>AGH</i> and
<i>GHD</i> equal, the exterior angle <i>EGB</i> equal to the
interior and opposite angle <i>GHD,</i> and the sum of the interior
angles on the same side, namely <i>BGH</i> and <i>GHD,</i> equal to
two right angles.</p>

<p>If the angle <i>AGH</i> does not equal the angle <i>GHD,</i>
then one of them is greater. Let the angle <i>AGH</i> be
greater.</p>
<p>Add the angle <i>BGH</i> to each. Therefore the sum of the
angles <i>AGH</i> and <i>BGH</i> is greater than the sum of the
angles <i>BGH</i> and <i>GHD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI13.html">I.13</a></div>
<p>But sum of the angles <i>AGH</i> and <i>BGH</i> equals two right
angles. Therefore the sum of the angles <i>BGH</i> and <i>GHD</i>
is less than two right angles.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="post5.html">Post.5</a></div>
<p>But straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than
two right angles meet. Therefore <i>AB</i> and <i>CD,</i> if
produced indefinitely, will meet. But they do not meet, because
they are by hypothesis parallel.</p>
<p>Therefore the angle <i>AGH</i> is not unequal to the angle
<i>GHD,</i> and therefore equals it.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI15.html">I.15</a>, <a href="cn.html">C.N.1</a></div>
<p>Again, the angle <i>AGH</i> equals the angle <i>EGB.</i>
Therefore the angle <i>EGB</i> also equals the angle
<i>GHD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.2</a></div>
<p>Add the angle <i>BGH</i> to each. Therefore the sum of the
angles <i>EGB</i> and <i>BGH</i> equals the sum of the angles
<i>BGH</i> and <i>GHD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI13.html">I.13</a><br />
<a href="cn.html">C.N.1</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the angles <i>EGB</i> and <i>BGH</i> equals two
right angles. Therefore the sum of the angles <i>BGH</i> and
<i>GHD</i> also equals two right angles.</p>
<p>Therefore <i>a straight line falling on parallel straight lines
makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the exterior angle
equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the sum of the
interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles.</i></p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
<p>The statement of this proposition includes three parts, one the
converse of <a href="propI27.html">I.27</a>, the other two the
converse of <a href="propI28.html">I.28</a>. Like those
propositions, this one assumes an ambient plane containing all the
three lines.</p>
<p>This is the first proposition which depends on the parallel
postulate. As such it does not hold in hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<h4><a id="hyperbolic" name="hyperbolic">Hyperbolic
geometry</a></h4>
Two important geometries alternative to Euclidean geometry are
elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry. Elliptic geometry was
discussed in the <a href="propI16.html#elliptic">note</a> after
Proposition I.16, that being the first proposition which doesn’t
hold in elliptic geometry. This, I.29, is the first which doesn’t
hold in hyperbolic geometry.
<p>These three geometries can be distinguished by the number of
lines parallel to a given line passing through a given point. For
elliptic geometry, there is no such parallel line; for Euclidean
geometry (which may be called parabolic geometry), there is exactly
one; and for hyperbolic geometry, there are infinitely many.</p>
<p>It is not possible to illustrate hyperbolic geometry with
correct distances on a flat surface since a flat surface is
Euclidean. Poincaré, however, described a useful model of
hyperbolic geometry where the “points” in a hyperbolic plane are
taken to be points inside a fixed circle (but not the points on the
circumference). The “lines” in the hyperbolic plane are the parts
of circles orthogonal, that is, at right angles to the fixed
circle. And in this model, “angles” in the hyperbolic plane are
angles between these arcs, or, more precisely, angles between the
tangents to the arcs at the point of intersection. Since “angles”
are just angles, this model is called a <i>conformal</i> model.
Distances in the hyperbolic plane, however, are not measured by
distances along the arcs. There is a more complicated relation
between distances so that near the edge of the fixed circle a very
short arc models a very long “line.”</p>
<table cellspacing="5">
<tr>
<td>Once this model is accepted, it is easy to see why there are
infinitely many “lines” parallel to a given “line” through a given
“point.” That is just that there are infinitely many circles
orthogonal to the fixed circle which don’t intersect the given
circle orthogonal to the fixed circle but do pass through the given
point.
<p>In the diagram, <i>AB</i> is a “line” in the hyperbolic plane,
that is, a circle orthogonal to the circumference of the shaded
disk which represents the hyperbolic plane. A “point” <i>C</i> lies
in that plane. Two “lines” are shown passing through <i>C,</i> one
gets close to the line <i>AB</i> in the direction of <i>A,</i> the
other gets close in the direction of <i>B.</i> But these two
“lines” don’t intersect <i>AB</i> since the arcs representing them
only intersect on the circumference of the disk, and points on the
circumference don’t represent “points” in the hyperbolic plane.</p>

<p>These two parallel “lines” are called the <i>asymptotic</i>
parallels of <i>AB</i> since they approach <i>AB</i> at one end or
the other. There are infinitely many parallels between them. (In
much of the literature on hyperbolic geometry, the word “parallels”
is used for what are called “asymptotic parallels” here, while
“nonintersecting lines” is used for what are called “parallels”
here.)</p>
<h4>Use of Proposition 29</h4>
This proposition is used in very frequently in Book I starting with
the next proposition. It is also used frequently in Book II, VI,
and XI, and once in Book XII.
