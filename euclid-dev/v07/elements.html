<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Euclid’s <i>Elements</i> form one of the most beautiful and
influential works of science in the history of humankind. Its
beauty lies in its logical development of geometry and other
branches of mathematics. It has influenced all branches of science
but none so much as mathematics and the exact sciences. The
<i>Elements</i> have been studied 24 centuries in many languages
starting, of course, in the original Greek, then in Arabic, Latin,
and many modern languages.</p>
<p>I'm creating this version of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i> for a
couple of reasons. The main one is to rekindle an interest in the
<i>Elements,</i> and the web is a great way to do that. Another
reason is to show how Java applets can be used to illustrate
geometry. That also helps to bring the <i>Elements</i> alive.</p>
<p>The text of all 13 Books is complete, and all of the figures are
illustrated using the Geometry Applet, even those in the last three
books on solid geometry that are three-dimensional. I still have a
lot to write in the guide sections and that will keep me busy for
quite a while.</p>
<p>This edition of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i> uses a Java applet
called the Geometry Applet to illustrate the diagrams. If you
enable Java on your browser, then you’ll be able to dynamically
change the diagrams. In order to see how, please read <a href=
"usingApplet.html">Using the Geometry Applet</a> before moving on
to the <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a>. <!--

I often hear that geometry is no longer taught well here in the United States high schools.  (I also
 understand that it is not taught at all in some high schools.)  This is a major problem because
 deductive logic is learned almost exclusively in geometry.  Without understanding logic, students
 will have difficulty in their daily lives, and difficulty in college, if they go on to college.

<p>Modern mathematics and science use deductive logic as a primary tool of understanding.  In
 mathematics, especially, nothing is considered to be known until it is proved.

<p>One contributing factor, perhaps the major contributing factor, to the downfall of geometry
 education in the United States is the way it is presented in text books.  If the logic is not
 presented in text books, it is very hard for the teacher to insert it in class.

<p>A recent text book, Prentice-Hall's <i>Geometry: tools for a changing world</i> shows how poor
 geometry education is today.  For details, see my <a href=geotfacw.html>review</a> of the book.
