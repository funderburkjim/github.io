<p>It is required to cut off from <i>AB</i> the greater a straight
line equal to <i>C</i> the less.</p>
<div class="just"><a href="propI2.html">I.2</a><br />
<a href="post3.html">I.Post.3</a></div>
<p>Place <i>AD</i> at the point <i>A</i> equal to the straight line
<i>C,</i> and describe the circle <i>DEF</i> with center <i>A</i>
and radius <i>AD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="defI15.html">I.Def.15</a></div>
<p>Now, since the point <i>A</i> is the center of the circle
<i>DEF,</i> therefore <i>AE</i> equals <i>AD.</i></p>
<div class="just"><a href="cn.html">C.N.1</a></div>
<p>But <i>C</i> also equals <i>AD,</i> therefore each of the
straight lines <i>AE</i> and <i>C</i> equals <i>AD,</i> so that
<i>AE</i> also equals <i>C.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, given the two straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>C,
AE</i> has been cut off from <i>AB</i> the greater equal to
<i>C</i> the less.</p>

<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
Now it is clear that the purpose of Proposition 2 is to effect the
construction in this proposition.
<p>According to Proclus (410–485 C.E.) in his <i>Commentary on Book
I,</i> Hippocrates of Chios (fl. ca. 430 B.C.E.) was the first to
write an <i>Elements.</i> Leon and Theudius also wrote versions
before Euclid (fl. ca. 295 B.C.E.). These other <i>Elements</i>
have all been lost since Euclid’s replaced them. It is conceivable
that in some of these earlier versions the construction in
proposition I.2 was not known, so this proposition would instead
have been a postulate (a stronger version of <a href="post3.html">I.Post.3</a>). Once the construction in I.2 was
discovered, the current weaker <a href="post3.html">I.Post.3</a>
would do. Then again, I.2 might go back to the time of
Hippocrates.</p>
<h4>Construction steps</h4>
This construction takes one more step beyond that of <a href="propI2.html">I.2</a>, and that is the final circle, the circle
shown in the diagram accompanying this proposition. Altogether,
therefore, five circles and two lines are required for this
construction.
<p>Frequently, though, one end of the line <i>C</i> is already
placed at <i>A,</i> and then the construction of I.2 isn’t
required. In that case, only one circle needs to be drawn.</p>
<h4>Use of Proposition 3</h4>
This proposition begins the geometric arithmetic of lines.
Explicitly, it allows lines to be subtracted, but it can also be
used to compare lines for equality and to add lines, that is, one
line can be placed alongside another to determine if they are
equal, or if not, which is greater. In other words, this
construction justifies the law of trichotomy for lines.
<p>The construction is use more often in the <i>Elements</i> than
any other starting with proposition <a href="propI5.html">I.5</a>.
It is used in all the books on geometry, that is in Books I through
IV, VI, and XI through XIII.</p>
<p>Naturally a construction of this sort is needed in the solid
geometry of Books XI through XIII. Surprisingly, the construction
given here also works in solid geometry, even the lines <i>AB</i>
and <i>C</i> don’t lie in the same plane. Since the point <i>A</i>
and the line <i>C</i> lie in one plane, the construction of
<a href="propI2.html">I.2</a> produces a line <i>AD</i> equal to
<i>C</i> in that plane. Now <i>AD</i> and <i>AB</i> also lie in one
plane, but not the same one, and the circle <i>AEF</i> can be drawn
there.</p>
