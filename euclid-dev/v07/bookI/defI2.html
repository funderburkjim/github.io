<h1>Definition 2</h1>
<div class="statement">A <i>line</i> is breadthless length.</div>
</div>
<h2><a id="guide" name="guide">Guide</a></h2>
“Line” is the second primitive term in the <i>Elements.</i> The
description, “breadthless length,” says that a line will have one
dimension, length, but it won’t have breadth. The terms length and
breadth are not defined in the <i>Elements.</i> In <a href="defI5.html">I.Def.5</a> a surface is defined with the two
dimensions length and breadth, and in <a href="../bookXI/defXI1.html">XI.Def.1</a> a solid is defined with the
three dimensions length, breadth, and depth.

<p>One cannot tell from this definition what kind of line is meant
by line, but later a straight line defined to be a special kind of
line. One can conclude, then, that lines need not be straight.
Perhaps “curve” would be a better translation than line since
Euclid meant what is commonly called a curve in modern English,
where a curve may or may not be straight.</p>
<p>Also, from the next definition, it is apparent that Euclid’s
lines may have ends, so they are line segments or curve segments.
But they need not have ends in all cases since the entire
circumference of a circle is an example of a line. Indeed, lines
need not be finite in all cases; there are a few instances in the
<i>Elements</i> where a line is not bounded, and that is usually
indicated by the language. See, for example, proposition <a href="propI12.html">I.12</a>.</p>

<p>One piece of terminology that Euclid did not mention explicitly
in a definition is a phrase to indicate when a line passes through
a point. That would be a primitive relation that could hold between
a line and a point. Postulates would be included as well to give
meaning to the phrase as they are in modern treatments of
elementary geometry.</p>
